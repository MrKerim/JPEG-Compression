# JPEG-Compression
In this repository I wil try to replicate the basic functionality of JPEG compression algorithm. In a basic sense here are the steps I will be coviring.

> Encoding procces
1. Color Transform
2. Down Sampling
3. Forward DCT
4. Quantization
---
I will use mostly jupyter notebook for this project. To get a general understanding of the encoding procces. Later I might try to recreate the algorithm with a GUI framework with a different language.
I will be following [this link](https://medium.com/geekculture/how-jpeg-compression-works-a751cd877c8c)
> Note that result is not intented to be more efficient. Rather my aim is to understand the general idea behind the JPEG and replicate it.
